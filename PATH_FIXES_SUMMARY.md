## Path Resolution Pattern Used

All files now use this pattern instead of relative paths:
```php
// Use absolute path resolution
$root_path = dirname(dirname(dirname(__DIR__))); // Adjust number of dirname() calls based on depth
require_once $root_path . '/config/session/patient_session.php';
require_once $root_path . '/config/db.php';
```

## Files That Still Need Fixing (If Issues Persist)

The following files still use relative paths but may need fixing if you encounter issues:

### Dashboard Files by Role
- `pages/management/bhw/dashboard.php`
- `pages/management/doctor/dashboard.php`
- `pages/management/nurse/dashboard.php`
- `pages/management/pharmacist/dashboard.php`
- `pages/management/dho/dashboard.php`
- `pages/management/laboratory_tech/dashboard.php`
- `pages/management/records_officer/dashboard.php`

### Patient Profile Files
- `pages/patient/profile/profile.php`
- `pages/patient/profile/profile_edit.php`
- `pages/patient/profile/medical_history_edit.php`
- `pages/patient/profile/actions/*.php`

### Auth Files
- `pages/management/auth/employee_forgot_password_*.php`
- `pages/management/auth/employee_reset_password.php`

## Quick Fix Script

If you encounter more path issues, use this pattern:
```php
$root_path = dirname(__DIR__, X); // Where X is the number of levels up to reach project root
```

Examples:
- For files in `pages/patient/auth/`: Use `dirname(__DIR__, 3)`
- For files in `pages/management/admin/`: Use `dirname(__DIR__, 3)`  
- For files in `pages/patient/`: Use `dirname(__DIR__, 2)`
- For files in `pages/patient/profile/actions/`: Use `dirname(__DIR__, 4)`
